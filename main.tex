	2020 -- &\graytext{\bf Senior Research Fellow} at \\
		& \large{\bf{Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata}}\\
		&	\\
		& \graytext{My current research is focused on trying to inculcate key features of \textbf{symbolic AI} techniques, like \textbf{domain knowledge augmentation, logical coherence}, etc into \textbf{deep learning} systems. Addition of logical constraints and pre-existing knowledge not only makes these systems more aligned to critical applications but also makes them more data efficient. This problem shows up in many domains and thus leads me to work in several fields like natural language, medicine, biology, astrophysics and diverse business applications.}\\
		&	\\
	2015--2020 &\graytext{\bf Integrated BS-MS} from \\
		& \large{\bf{Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata}}\\
		&	\\
		& \graytext{I graduated with a major in \textbf{Physics} and a minor in \textbf{Mathematics}. The plethora of advanced Mathematics and Physics courses equipped me with the tools required to tackle today's challenges in the field of Deep Learning and gives me a deeper insight into its inner machinations. My master's dissertation dealt with the issue of \textbf{Adversarial Robustness in Deep Learning systems}. We found that there is a natural correspondence between the ``over-fitting'' problem and the lack of robustness. We demonstrated that some of the techniques we use to avoid over-fitting also yield better adversarial robustness and that model architecture should be informed keeping these considerations in mind.}\\
